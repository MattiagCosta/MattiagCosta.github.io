			<div><h1>Whole Numbers</h1></div>
			<div>
				<p>Whole Numbers are strings of figures, defined by the user, that represent a positive number. You can compare and do operations with Whole Numbers, as well as other things. The user can work with Whole Numbers not only in the decimal base, but in any base they can think of. The concept is flexible, so that the source code for Whole Numbers can be written in multiple programming languages.</p>
				<h2>Download for C++</h2>
				<p>Download the necessary files to work with Whole Numbers: <a href="DownloadableFiles/WholeNumbers.cpp" download="WholeNumbers.cpp">WholeNumbers.cpp</a> and <a href="DownloadableFiles/WholeNumbers.h" download="WholeNumbers.h">WholeNumbers.h</a>.</p>

				<h2>Dynamic List</h2>
				<p>A Dynamic array that stores pointers to the heap. This library offers functions to work with this type of list, such as adding and searching elements. Storing data in the heap is a common task in C-programming: the Dynamic List can help achieving this task easily. Dynamic Lists are allocated in the heap too, so they need to be freed with the functions provided by the library.<br>Download the necessary files here: <a href="DownloadableFiles/DynamicList.c" download="DynamicList.c">DynamicList.c</a>, <a href="DownloadableFiles/DynamicList.h" download="DynamicList.h">DynamicList.h</a>.</p>
				<h2>Lapse Counter</h2>
				<p>This weirdly named structure counts how many times it is called within a certain amount of time. It can be useful to count the iterations of a loop every second, or to use it as a timer.<br>Download these files to use Lapse Counters: <a href="DownloadableFiles/LapseCounter.c" download="LapseCounter.c">LapseCounter.c</a>, <a href="DownloadableFiles/LapseCounter.h" download="LapseCounter.h">LapseCounter.h</a>.</p>

				<h2>Table of elements</h2>
				<p>This library offers a TableOfElements class with some useful functions to work with. Instead of creating one from scratch, use this Table to complete your task faster.<br>Download the files: <a href="DownloadableFiles/TableOfElements.h" download="TableOfElements.h">TableOfElements.h</a> and <a href="DownloadableFiles/TableOfElements.tpp" download="TableOfElements.tpp">TableOfElements.tpp</a> (already included in the header).</p>
